# June 17th: Finishing touches

Made the brackets to hold the laser engraver as well as the box for the electronics 

## What did I do ?
- Designed
    - a bracket to attach the laser engraver onto the linear block for the x-axis
    - a box that mounts onto the side of the frame that can hold all of the wiring, CNC shield, and other components for the laser engraver.

## Issues 
- While trying to align everything with the GT2 belts, I realized that the Idle pulley that I made had the wrong dinmensions, so I had to remake then and then move all the other components.
  
## Major Imporvments 
- Learned how to use the align tool in Fusion 

## Next time
- try importing a 3D model since it will be more accurate
