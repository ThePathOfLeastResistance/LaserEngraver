# June 20th: Working ON Version 2

Since the bracket for connecting the linear rail blocks to the 2020 aluminum extrusions were designed really poorly interms of printability and just the design in general, I decided to redesign it.  

## What did I do ?
  - Deleted the old connector brakects and started the design for a new one.
