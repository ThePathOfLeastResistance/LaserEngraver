# June 16th: ALMOST FINSIHED  

Had to redesign the right connector and also made the left side connector from the linear block to the 2020 aluminum extrusion. 
 
## What did I do ?
- Designed
    - Had to redesign the linear block connector since on one side, the belts were not aligned.

## Issues 
- Again, looking at the slicer, when I am printing this connector, there is no good surface where the printer can start, and hence, alot of it needs support which not only wastes a lot of pla but also makes the print quatily a lot worse. 
  
## Major Imporvments 
- Should be done the version 1 soon. 

## Next time
- I really need to figure out a way to better style the images on each of the journal, I tried twice but both times it just messed everything up.
