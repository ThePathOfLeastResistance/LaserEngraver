# June 19th: Working ON Version 2

I had realized the dimensions for the linear rail block was off as well so they had to be remade and the parts that connects to the block all had to be realigned

## What did I do ?
  - Resized the linear Rail block.
  - Change the screw holes for the linear block on the brackets.
