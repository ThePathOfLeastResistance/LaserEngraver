## Issues 
- Looking at the Orca Slicer, the way the parts were designed NEEDs to be improved so that the printing expereince is eaiser and faster and with less support.
- The belts and the pulley were not alining, not too sure why but it is uneven on one of the sides. For version 2, I think I want to redesign them.
- Also I need to figure out a way to insert pictures with a height and width instead of having them all at one place. 
  
## Major Imporvments 
- Almost finished the designs.
