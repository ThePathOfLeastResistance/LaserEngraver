# June 21th: Working ON Version 2

Looking at the laser engraver connector, they were way too complex and printing them using supports would be a nightmare. So I tried to design a better one. 

## What did I do ?
  - Redesigned the bracket to hold the linear block with the laser engraver and the GT2 belts

## Issues 

## Major Imporvments 
- In the past, when I copied and pasted an component, the new component was often linked with the other one. Hence, when I deleted one, it would affect the timeline and mess up the other parts. Turns out instead of using delete, I could use the remove command.
