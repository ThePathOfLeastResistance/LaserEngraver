# June 14th: Made most of the componenets 

Made the Idle pulley holder, and the stepper motor mount, should be finished the 3d designing by tomorrow.

## What did I do ?
- Designed
    - pulley holders
    - linear rail connectors
    - stepper motor mount
- fixed the linear block importing issue by just designing it myself instead of importing it

## Issues 
- There are still issues with importing things and when turning them into objects, they always mess up
- Dealing with parts joining while designing stuff,  like the 2020 attaching to the motor bracket, so I turn all the 2020s into components instead of bodies.
