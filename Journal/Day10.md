# June 22th: Working ON Version 2

Added the tensioners for the top of the bracket. 

## What did I do ?
  - With the linear block, I tired a lot of different designs but in the end, I ended up with a nut and screw

## Issues 
- One of the major issues was getting all the measurements for the screw and also making sure everything was aligned.
- I also tried to make the design as simple as possible but there still could be more imporvements made.
