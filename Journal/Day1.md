# June 12th: Got the Basic Frame

Made the frame of the engraver in Fusion. Was going to continue to design but I remember a vid from Stuff Made Here, where he talked about a different system for the belt that was better. 

## What did I do ?
- Imported and assmbled the basics parts for the frame
    - 2020 Aluminum extrusions x 600mm x 4
    - 20mm connectors 
    - MGN12 Linear Rail x 550mm x 2
- Designed the feet for the printer
  - Wanted to make it adjustable but it would be undone by the shaking of the laser engraver

## Issues 
- one issue that I keep running into was when I was trying to import a 3d model of the Block for the MGN12, the models were all too detailed so when I converted the mesh it always messed up, I tired 4 or 5 times with different models and they all failed. 

## Major Imporvments 
- Found a great website to convert .step to .stl since GrabCad had most of their files in .step but fusion only takes stl (I think)
- https://convert3d.org/step-to-stl/app

## Additional Notes
- Looking at the video from Stuff Made Here channel, I really wanted to switch it to a CoreXY than the original cartesian system. Since I planned on making something that I wanted to use in the future, might as well spend more time to make a better version now. Also I thought it would be really cool to see and try to understand the CoreXY system since a lot of laser engravers and 3d printers used them. However while researching, there was not a lot of information about it and I kinda gave up for the day.
